# SQL Logic for Capabillities
The below capabillities will be spilt evenly amongst team members.  Pick two capabillities you would like to implement by editing this document and inserting your name after the capability number (e.g. Capabillity n -- John Smith).  Most, but not all, will involve SQL logic.  Develop your logic and insert it below your capabillities description.
